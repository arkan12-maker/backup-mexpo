/**
 * Centralized TanStack Query key factory.
 *
 * Every query in the app is keyed through here so invalidation after a
 * mutation (`queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey })`) is always precise
 * and never relies on ad-hoc string literals scattered in components.
 *
 * Naming convention:
 *   <domain>.<resource> = list base key (invalidate all lists of that resource)
 *   <domain>.<resource>(params) = a specific list/detail instance
